Predict demand  analysis of a sales company to generate more revenue
This is a product sales analysis of a drink company from 2012 -2018 using Excel and Power BI.

 changing data types, 
replacing null values,
 removal of duplicates,
creating data models,
Visuals were used to track trends, outliers and performances,
Insights were recommended
The data was analyzed.
From my analysis some shops were generating more revenue when compared against others    
The shops in Athens generated a revenue of over 54Million dollars, followed by Patra with over 50Million dollars
Sales increased across the years(2012-2018)
In 2012, 28Million was generated as the total revenue while 32Million was generated in 2018 which shows increase over the years
Adult-Cola is seen as the best selling brand with over 49million dollars generated in total revenue followed by orange-power wit over 48million dollars
Shop 6 generated the highest revenue with over 50million dollars followed by shop 4 with total revenue of over 40million dollars.
More shops should be opened in Athens and Patra as the shops in the city are making more sales
Since Adult-cola and Orange power are contributing immensely to the revenue of the company, these products should never be out of stock, and a survey should be made to find out why they are preferred and similar product could also be sampled
Promos and discounts can be introduced especially in the shops with low sales to boost sales and to bring in new customers
Training should also be given to the staff in the low performance stores as poor customer service can also result in low sales.
